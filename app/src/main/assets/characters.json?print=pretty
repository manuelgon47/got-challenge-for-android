Perhaps the greatest swordsman in the kingdom, Jaime is sometimes derisively called 'the Kingslayer' because he killed the 'Mad King' Aerys Targaryen in the coup that put Robert on the Iron Throne.Eric Dodds of Time described Jaime as 'handsome, an incomparably skilled fighter and disarmingly witty', with The New Yorker calling the Lannisters 'a crowd of high-cheekboned beauties ... who form a family constellation so twisted, charismatic, and cruel that it rivals Flowers in the Attic for blond dysfunction'. Lev Grossman wrote for Time that while Jaime and Cersei's younger brother Tyrion is a grotesque dwarf, 'the rest of the Lannisters are stunted too, but on the inside.'",

Described as having strong Stark features with a lean build, long face, dark brown hair and grey eyes, he has the surname 'Snow'—customary for illegitimate children in the North—and is resented by Stark's wife Catelyn as a reminder of Ned's affair. Jon is the same age as Robb and enjoys a warm relationship with his siblings, particularly the tomboy Arya, who resembles Jon and, like him, does not feel like she fits in. Ned treats Jon as much like his other children as propriety and his honor will allow; still, as somewhat of an outsider, Jon has learned to be independent and to fend for himself when necessary. Jon idolizes his father, but is wounded by Ned's refusal to identify his mother. At the beginning of the story, Jon adopts the albino direwolf he names Ghost; he later finds that at times he can 'inhabit' the wolf and share its experiences.",

His name is pronounced 'Torgo Nudho' in Valyrian and was chosen by his Astapor slave masters, who choose new names for the Unsullied which are designed to humiliate them and make them think they are not human. Despite this, Grey Worm chose to keep his current name because it was his name on the day Daenerys freed the Unsullied, so he considers it to be a lucky name. He is loyal to Daenerys and doesn't like those who insult her. He develops feelings for Missandei, which appear to be reciprocated, and has a friendly rivalry with Daario Naharis. He is gravely injured in Meereen in an attack by the Sons of the Harpy, but ultimately survives.",
